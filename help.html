				<h3>Learn the rules</h3>
				<p>
					If you're having trouble in games or are finding yourself confused by
					moves made, you might not understand all the new rules. By visiting
					the rules page you can better understand how the game works and have
					more fun playing other people.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="activity">
				<h3>Play against yourself</h3>
				<p>
					While reading the rules can help you understand the game more,
					sometime you need to see rules in action to understand them. You can
					do this by playing against yourself in the offline mode.
