				<h2 class="pagetitle">Anarchy Chess Rules</h2>
				<p>
					AnarchyChess has many rules, with new rules being added or existing
					rules being changed every week. Whether you got confused by something
					you saw in a game, or are just interested in what new rules exist,
					this is the first place you should consult.

			<div class="section">
				<h3>En Passant</h3>
				<p>
					This rule is a classic, with a pawn being able to capture any pawn
					that jumps two squares directly beside it the move after. However,
					when capturing En Passant to the left, the capturing pawn now moves
					back-right one square instead of forward-left.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Knight boost</h3>
				<p>
					Normally, when promoting a pawn people choose to make a queen.
					Sometimes a rook or bishop to avoid stalemate. But knights are often
					underappreciated. So, promoting to a knight is now forced.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Rookless Rooks</h3>
				<p>
					Rooks, well, aren't really rooks. They are unable to move, except for
					jumping all the way across the board to capture the opponents rook on
					the same file. If rooks are still on the board, though, some
					stalemates may be prevented. And this does mean no castling.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Short-range Bishops</h3>
				<p>
					Tired of being snipped by bishops across the board? Well, bishops now
					can only move 1 or 2 squares. They also only move right. They can jump
					over pieces now, though.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h3>Kings can't go to C2</h3>
				<p>
					This rule is as simple as it sounds. Kings are simply unable to move
					to the C2 square in any situation.
